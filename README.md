# CS308 Final Project: Face Recognition

## Introduction
This repository contains the final project report for the CS308 (Computer Vision) class focusing on the topic of face recognition. The project utilized VGG-Face2 as the dataset and compared the performance of three different models. The results indicate that the VGG-Face model achieved the highest accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Dataset: VGG-Face2
- Framework: Django
- Third-party package: DeepFace
- Generative Model: DiscoFaceGAN

## Features
- Implemented DeepFace methods using the Django framework
- Uploading personal images for face recognition
- Generated fake faces using DiscoFaceGAN
- Demonstrated comparison results using DeepFace

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the following commands:
   - `python manage.py makemigrations`
   - `python manage.py migrate`
   - `python manage.py runserver`
4. Upload personal images for face recognition.
5. Explore the results of the comparison between different models.
